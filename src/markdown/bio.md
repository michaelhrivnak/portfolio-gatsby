#BIO           
***

My path to web development has been a long and winding road that began as a child, learning Basic from floppy discs on my family's 486 machine.
I strayed from this path many times over the years but have since found my way back in the last couple of years assisting on a web development
project at my day job. Recently I've spent a lot of time thinking about User Interfaces and User Experience; the topic fascinates
and I aim to explore it in much more depth in the future.
            
When I'm not at work drawing up floor plans I can usually be found playing the latest digital card game (right now its Magic: The Gathering Arena).
For many years growing up I wanted to be a game developer but while game design and game systems interest me a great deal, I do not have the hands
art, which has lead me more to thinking about overall design principles and UX.

When I have even more free time I love to explore the city and find new restaurants to try with my wife or even find a new and interesting recipe to try
to make at home. I am always trying to add my own spin to a recipe, as I am constantly thinking about how to improve or alter things. This can lead
to disastrous results though!
